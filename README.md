# HOW THIS GEM IS TESTED

SETUP:
• Run bundle install
• if you can't get through see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68050807/gem-install-mimemagic-v-0-3-10-fails-to-install-on-big-sur/68170982#68170982


The dummy sandbox is found at `spec/dummy`

The dummy sandbox lives as mostly checked- into the repository, **except** the folders where the generated code goes (`spec/dummy/app/views/`, `spec/dummy/app/controllers/`, `spec/dummy/specs/` are excluded from Git)

When you run the **internal specs**, which you can do **at the root of this repo** using the command `rspec`, a set of specs will run to assert the generators are erroring when they are supposed to and producing code when they are supposed to.

The DUMMY testing DOES NOT test the actual functionality of the output code (it just tests the functionality of the generation process).


# DATABASE

`cd spec/dummy`
`rake db:drop`
`rake db:create db:migrate`

`cd ../..`

take note that when running the spec at the root of the repo you are initializing the Dummy app, which will use the 
SQLite database in spec/dummy/database/
